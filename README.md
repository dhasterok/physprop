 A set of C and MatLab codes for estimating physical properties

 Computes physical properties using the constants in Hasterok & Chapman, EPSL, 2011.  Rocks are constructed from mineral proportions and then the physical properties calculations have been validated for some of the physical properties against laboratory measurements, namely thermal conductivity and diffusivity.

 The MatLab scripts produce fits to some of these data including Labani Ray et al. diffusivity data and the BALM lherzolite conductivities by Tommassi et al.
