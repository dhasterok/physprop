This file details the use of a set of c-functions to estimate rock properties
given a mineralogy, which can be incorporated into other modeling codes.

----
Each mineral is described by a unique code summarized below and is used in the
input file to "build" the composition of the desired rock.

    Mineral index key
     0: alpha-quartz      10: Fe-epidote          20: wollastonite        30: grossular
     1: beta-quartz       11: clinochlore         21: enstatite           31: spessartine
     2: orthoclase        12: daphnite            22: ferrosillite        32: aragonite
     3: sanadine          13: hornblende          23: forsterite          33: calcite
     4: albite            14: tremolite           24: fayalite            34: dolomite
     5: anorthite         15: ferro-actinolite    25: spinel              35: andalucite

     7: paragonite        17: diopside            27: hercynite           37: sillimanite
     8: phlogopite        18: hedenbergite        28: pyrope              38: rutile

Files:

rockprop.c - front end to compute physical properties found in physprop.c

physprop.c - library of functions to compute physical properties
physprop.h - contains function prototypes and important constants

Makefile - makes executable rockprop


----
Usage:
    rockprop infile [outfile]

    infile contains the input rock types and desired pressure and temperature
    conditions to compute the physical properties

    outfile is optional (otherwise prints to stdout)

File formats:

infile:
    All blank lines or lines starting with '%', or '#' are assumed to be comments

    Line 1:
        [number of samples] [conductivity type]
        conductivity types include:
            -1 - effective, lattice, and radiative as separate columns
             0 - effective only
             1 - lattice only
             2 - radiative only

    Line 2:
        [number of minerals]

    Line 3+ (next no. minerals lines):
        [mineral number] [mass fraction/percent]
        The total mass fraction does not need to sum to 1 as is typical with
        values reported in publications because they are normalized to 1.

    Line 4: 
        [condition flag]
        indicates whether the pressure/temperature conditions to be entered
        are (0) temperature and pressure steps or (1) specified pressure and
        temperatures

    If condition flag == 0
        Line 5: [Number of T steps] [T step (K)] [starting T (K)]
        Line 6: [Number of P steps] [P step (GPa)] [starting P (GPa)]

    If condition flag == 1
        Line 5: [Number of P/T steps]
        Line 6: [P (GPa)] [T (K)]
        

outfile:

The composition for each rock is presented before the properties, but is
commented out and the modeled data are presented in columns so that they may be
easily read into MatLab.  Compositions are reported in mass percent (normalized).

Column 1: pressure [GPa]
Column 2: temperature [K]
Column 3: expansivity [K^-1]
Column 4: density [kg m^-3]
Column 5: specific heat capacity [J kg^-1 K^-1]
Column 6: thermal conductivity [W m^-1 K^-1]
 If the conductivity option -1 is selected the column 6 is effective, 7 is
 lattice and 8 is radiative
Column 7: thermal diffusivity [m^2 s^-1]
 If the conductivity option -1 is selected the column 9 is effective, 10 is
 lattice and 11 is radiative

Each rock is separated from the next by a full row of NaN's so that they can be
easily identified in MatLab using the isnan function.
